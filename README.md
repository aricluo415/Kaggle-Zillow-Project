Group Members

* Abhay Sawhney
* Anastasia Levchenko
* Aric Luo
* Arthur Hlaing
* Matt Reese
* Nir Voloshin
* Tyler Gordon

*** One of our group members had a change of heart at the end of week 7 to pursue another project even though we had already finalized the group during week 2. This was unexpected but this is the reason why we ended up with 7 members for our project instead of the required minimum of 8. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ಠ_ಠ ***

* Our dataset is obtained from 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1
* You may need to sign up for the competition in order to obtain the data
* Our dataset is too large to be uploaded to GitHub or submitted through Canvas
* You can email us if you have trouble accessing the data or if you do not want to make an account to have access to the data
* Data preprocessing sections are identical between ANN and Linear Regression
* For XGBoost, it is similar but it does not fill the missing values nor normalize the data
* Before running the notebooks, you will need to install xgboost and tensorflow
* We hope you enjoy our project! Cheers! :)
